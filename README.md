# StyleGAN2-Latent-Space-Manipulation
This project explores latent space manipulation using the StyleGAN2-ADA architecture to control semantic facial attributes. By training a ResNet18 classifier on the CelebA dataset, a "Smiling" attribute detector was developed to label 5,000 synthetic images generated by the model.
